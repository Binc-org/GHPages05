# GHPages05

This was interesting, I created this new GHPages05, and there was nothing, then I added a README.md...

OK 

then I went to settings and made it into a GH PAGES...

THEN it added an index.md file and also a Config.yml   as a Subfolder 

IT does open as a GH page site...but compair it ti GHPages04 I did earlier...

confusing isn't it?

I had issues cloning across because earlier I did a GIT build for the same REPO name, I since deleted that and cloned.
